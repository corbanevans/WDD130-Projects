    <h2>Corban Evans</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Corban Evans and I am a Computer Science major from Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my entire life, but my grandparents were converts and I have a lot of family who are nonmembers, so I wouldn't say I grew up in a religious bubble, especially considering the member population in my hometime was pretty small.
       I served my mission in San Bernardino, California, and I am actually getting ready for a mission reunion in a couple of weeks.</p>
    <p>I am hoping to use my degree to pursue Cybersecurity as a career, I just love the puzzle solving and think-outside-the-box attitude that the field requires.
       Even though I am not pursuing web development as a career, my girlfriend is and I have seen the advantages that she has experienced, especially with the internship she just started. It is very cool I think, to be able to see the code you make have a very visible outcome, the way that web development allows for that. You can modigy everything, from the basic things like font and color, all the way to CSS mods like creating animations and interactive environments.</p>
