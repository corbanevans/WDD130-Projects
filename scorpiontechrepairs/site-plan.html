      <h3>About Me</h3> 
      <p>
        My name is Corban Evans, and I am a Computer and Information Technology Major at BYUI with over 10 years of experience with Computers and Electronics Repairs. I have official certifications in Android, Apple, and Microsoft Troubleshooting and Repair, as well as training in Network Administration, and experience working professionally in IT.</p>
      <p>
        I am a one-man operation, which means you will always be communicating directly with me and my knowledge and experience rather than chasing down someone through a phone tree or dealing with reception. </p>
      <p> 
        I know that so many people struggle with getting errands done during the day due to most businesses being open the same time that everyone is working, and that is why I started Twilight Tech Repair, a business open from just before the dinner hour until well after the sun has set giving both those who work nights, and those who work days the option and ability to make sure their crucial devices get repaired and stay in working order, so you don’t have to take time out of your work schedule to get those needed phones and computers, back in business.</p>
      <p>
        Twilight Tech Repair… changing our schedule, so you don’t have to.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        How is cost calculated?
        The cost of your repair is calculated based on what repairs are needed and the amount of time it will take to complete. I have a personal guarantee to match any quote for labor costs and beat it by 20% and I do not upcharge for parts that are purchased for your repair. Diagnosis and price quote for your repair are free as well as any repairs I can do without parts in under 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you make House Calls?
        Yes, I do! My service area is the entirety of Rexburg city limits, as well as tech advice and online support globally.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not the most tech-savvy individual, do you offer tutoring?
        I do, I tutor individually on campus on a select number of topics. Let me know what you are interested in learning more about and I can set up a personalized curriculum for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not sure what is wrong with my computer, can you still fix it even if I can’t explain the issue very well?
        Not a problem, we can have a conversation about you what recognize is different about how your computer is behaving, along with what you would like to see from your computer, such as speed, capability, applications, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you service businesses?
        Of course! I specialize in small to medium sized businesses, and I can help with new software solutions and implementations, network troubleshooting and administration, as well as general issues that an in-house IT department would resolve for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I need my computer fixed ASAP, is that possible?
        While I do have a first come, first serve policy, I do have a Rush Service available for an extra fee. That would push your computer to the front of the queue. While this is an option, it is possible, depending on the issues with the device, that parts needed to make the repair are coming from overseas and repair time will be at the mercy of shipping companies. If this is the case, I will do everything in my power to locate alternate suppliers and work with you on costs and such.
